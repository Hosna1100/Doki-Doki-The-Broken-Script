# Doki Doki The Broken Script
 - The game glitches and fractures. Dialogue repeats, characters glitch out, and scenes loop endlessly.
    - The MC realizes they're trapped in a broken narrative. Monika, who once manipulated the game, is now powerless to fix it.
    - The girls' personalities warp, and their poems become distorted reflections of their fractured minds.
